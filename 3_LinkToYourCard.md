# Link to your Card
If you are here you must have completed the exercise. You can push your branch up and submit a pull request.

Check out the main branch, update your local repository, and create a NEW branch. Now you will be working on creating a link to your page. 

On the home.html page modify Contact button on your card to be a link to your html page:

```js
 <p><button class="button">Contact</button></p>
```
Try to figure this one out. The button should read "My Project" and be a simple link to your newly created html page.

Once you are done make sure to push your branch up and submit a pull request. 

Make sure that your local repository has everyone's changes and you are able to view it locally.
