- Did they submit the picture correctly (is it square? is it clear? does it show the whole person?)
- Did they submit a screen shot of the completed card?
- Did they submit comments following the standard (see below for a refresher)?
```
- What?
- Why?
- How?
- Testing?
- Screenshots (optional)
- Anything Else?
```

### Review: Comments
Whether you are approving or requesting changes make sure to leave comments. Remember that you can also "just" leave a comment that does **not** approve or request changes. Some guidelines about comments:

- Familiarize yourself with the context of the issue, and reasons why this Pull Request exists.
- If you disagree strongly, consider giving it a few minutes before responding; think before you react.
- Ask, don‚Äôt tell. (‚ÄúWhat do you think about trying‚Ä¶?‚Äù rather than ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt do‚Ä¶‚Äù)
- Explain your reasons why code should be changed. (Not in line with the style guide? A personal preference?)
- Offer ways to simplify or improve code.
- Avoid using derogatory terms, like ‚Äúdumb‚Äù, when referring to the work someone has produced.
- Be humble. (‚ÄúI‚Äôm not sure, let‚Äôs try‚Ä¶‚Äù)
- Avoid hyperbole. (‚ÄúNEVER do‚Ä¶‚Äù)
- Aim to develop professional skills, group knowledge and product quality, through group critique.
- Be aware of negative bias with online communication. (If content is neutral, we assume the tone is negative.) Can you use positive language as opposed to neutral?
- It's ok to use emojis to clarify tone. Compare "üëå Good job üëç‚Äù to ‚ÄúGood job.‚Äù Obviously, there will be workplace guidelines aoprunf this that you will need to follow.
