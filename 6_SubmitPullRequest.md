# Submit a Pull Request

You pushed your branch changes and are now ready to merge them into the main branch.  A project will have certain rules around pull requests. In 99.9% of cases you will NOT be able to merge your changes directly into the main branch without a review and approval from another member of the project. This is to protect the main branch from any code that could break it. Remember that "social" contract?
