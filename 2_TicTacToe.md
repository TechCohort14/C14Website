# Tic Tac Toe
You will be referencing this [Tic Tac Toe](https://www.codebrainer.com/blog/tic-tac-toe-javascript-game) exercise. It is well guided and will provide you with the building blocks for a basic game. Some important chnages to teh instructions that they provide. Since each person will be working on their own html page, CSS stylesheet, and javascript. Some steps have been taken care of.    

 
### Clone the repository
First step will be to clone this repository. You can refer to previous [exercise](https://github.com/TechCohort14/TA100-GitFlowWebsite/blob/main/4_CloneWebsite.md) to figure out how to clone the repository. 

Once you clone the repository make sure to create a branch. 

### HTML, TTTstyle.css, ans Script.js Page:
The nameTicTacToe.html will be the base html. You will **COPY** this file and rename it by using your first and last name initial. So "Jane Doe" will copy the nameTicTacToe.html file and rename it jdTicTacToe.html. 

Do the same for the TTTstyle.css and script.js. Make sure to copy and rename. So "Jane Doe" will have three files:

```js
jdTicTacToe.html
jdstyle.css
jdscript.js
```
In the you htmml file you will have to change the link to the css and javascript file.
