# Tic Tac Toe
You will be referencing this [Tic Tac Toe](https://www.codebrainer.com/blog/tic-tac-toe-javascript-game) exercise. It is well guided and will provide you with the building blocks for a basic Tic Tac Toe game. There are some important changes to the instructions that they provide. Since each person will be working on their own html page, CSS stylesheet, and javascript we need to make sure you have your own. Please follow the steps below before getting started.    

 
### 1. Clone the repository
First step will be to clone this repository. You can refer to previous [exercise](https://github.com/TechCohort14/TA100-GitFlowWebsite/blob/main/4_CloneWebsite.md) to figure out how to clone the repository. 

Once you clone the repository make sure to create a branch. 

### 2. HTML, TTTstyle.css, ans Script.js Page:
Before you get started, make sure you are on your own branch (not main branch). Unlike the home page that everyone worked on, in this exercise will have three files to work on. The nameTicTacToe.html will be the base html. You will **COPY** this file and rename it by using your first and last name initial. So "Jane Doe" will copy the nameTicTacToe.html file and rename it jdTicTacToe.html. 

Do the same for the **TTTstyle.css** and **script.js**. Make sure to copy and rename. So "Jane Doe" will have three files:

```js
jdTicTacToe.html
jdstyle.css
jdscript.js
```
In **your** html file you will have to change the link to the css and javascript file. 

```js
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
 <meta charset="UTF-8">
 <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
 <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
 <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css"> <!-- DO NOT CHANGE THIS LINK -->
 <link rel="stylesheet" href="TTTstyle.css">  <!-- Change file name here to point to your file -->
 <script src="script.js"></script>            <!-- Change file name here to point to your file -->
 <title>Tic-Tac-Toe - CodeBrainer</title>
</head>
```
### 3. Follow along with exercise: 
Before you get started, make sure you are on your own branch (can't stress this enough). Now you can actually follow along with the [exercise](https://www.codebrainer.com/blog/tic-tac-toe-javascript-game). 

As you follow along on the exercise make sure to preview your work to see how you are doing. This way you can catch any bugs before the end. 

Feel free modify your CSS file to style it the way you want. 

When your game is working you are ready to link it to the home page within your card.
