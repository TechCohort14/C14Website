### Tic Tac Toe: 

### GitHub:
GitHub is a for-profit company that offers a cloud-based Git repository hosting service. Essentially, it makes it a lot easier for individuals and teams to use Git for version control and collaboration. So, while Git is storing your code locally, GitHub is where you can store your code remotely and share with others. It's important to remember that GitHub is **_not_** Git. There are other companies who offer hosting services that do the same thing as GitHub, such as Bitbucket and GitLab, but GitHub is by far the most widely used, with over 100 million developers.

GitHubâ€™s interface is user-friendly enough so even novice coders can take advantage of Git. Without GitHub, using Git generally requires a bit more technical savvy and use of the command line.

### GitHub Workflow:
What does the work flow look like? Each circle represents a commit or change in the software. The green is the master or main source code. The blue and orange are branches of the main branch. Notice that you can have other branches of the code that can eventually merge into the main branch.
